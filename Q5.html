        Cricket is not just a game; it’s an emotion shared by millions around the world. 
        From the sound of the bat striking the ball to the roar of the crowd, 
        every moment on the field tells a story of passion, dedication, and teamwork.

        The sport has evolved over time — from the classic five-day Test matches 
        to the fast-paced T20 leagues. Each format has its own charm, 
        but the spirit of cricket remains the same: respect, discipline, and fair play.

        Whether it’s watching your favorite player score a century or witnessing a nail-biting finish, 
        cricket brings people together like nothing else. It teaches us patience, strategy, 
        and the beauty of sportsmanship.
